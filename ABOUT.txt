This is my implementation of the ICI concept drift detection proposed in "Just-In-Time Classifiers for Recurrent Concepts" by Cesare Alippi, Giacomo Boracchi and Manuel Roveri.

The main file is jit.m
It generates data (you can change the type of data using generate_scalarN with N=[1..4]), detects when the concept changed and refines the estimate of the time of change as describe in the paper.

You need PrToolBox for these files to work.
The file "dissertation - Fabio - DGA1032.pdf" is a report about the ICI Rule for concept drift detection and an explanation of my implementation of it.
